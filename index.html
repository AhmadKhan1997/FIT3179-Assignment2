  <div class="container" style="border: 2px solid #000; background-color: lightgrey;">  <div class="center-div"><p>The bar chart shows the number of road accidents in India from 2016 to 2019. Overall from the chart we can interpret that the number of road accidents has been increasing over the years

    The top three states with the highest number of road accidents in 2019 were Tamil Nadu,Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. These states accounted for over 30% of all road accidents in India.

    <div class="container" style="border: 2px solid #000; background-color: lightgrey;">
      <div class="center-div">
        <div id="linechart"></div>
        <p>The line chart shows the number of road accidents per 10,000 vehicles on a yearly basis in India from 2016 to 2021. The number of road accidents per 10,000 vehicles has been decreasing over the years, from 28.5 in 2016 to 1.3 in 2019 for ANdhra Pradesh and it is similar for almost all other states as well

          This suggests that while the number of road accidents has been increasing overall, the rate of road accidents per vehicle has been decreasing. This is likely due to a number of factors, including improved road infrastructure, stricter enforcement of traffic laws, and increased awareness of road safety.
